# animatedInstructions for Psychtoolbox
Animated instructions is thought of as a collection of scripts to make instructions for experiments with the Psychtoolbox animated.
For now only the response box Cedrus RB-844 is supported. But the RB-740, RB-840 and RB-540 should be added in the near future, as well as 'normal keyboards'.

## Features
- drawResponseBox.m draws the response box (currently only the Cedrus RB-844)
- In this script you can specify custom keys
- You can specify a clicked button, which emulates a button press
- Pregenerate a response box as an image to increase the loading times

## 'Whishlist'
- Define solid colors instead of custom images
- Support different response boxes
- Implement other general keyboards
- Improve the finger animation (speed, duration)
- Show a monitor
- Create a interaction between response box and monitor (on clicking a button on the response box the screen on the monitor changes)

If you have ideas, suggestions and whishes you can add an issue or join the project!
